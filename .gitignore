# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install different versions of packages depending on
#   the platform. These differences may result in conflicts when merging changes or pull requests.
#   In such cases, it may be desirable to ignore Pipfile.lock.
# Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   The same considerations mentioned above apply.
